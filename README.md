## Impressionist

Who worked on this project?
Ethan Husted and Aakash Shameer 

What operating system did you develop on?
We worked on both Windows and Mac, however, most of our coding was done on Windows due to the trouble of seeing the solution on the Mac.

How did you split work amongst partners (if any) in this project?
We kinda coded together using pair-programming through most of the code but towards the end, we each took a task and split it to complete it in time. 

## Bells and Whistles

Which bells and whistles did you attempt to do, which did you complete?
We attempted and completed the radius and density slider and making a new brush, "Triangles". 

Was there anything out of the ordinary that we should know about?
No, not really. 

## Feedback

About how long did you and your partners (if any) spend on this project?
We spent a total of 23 hours on this assignment. We started it late and burned the midnight oil to finish it in time. We definitely feel like this project was difficult given the lack of instructions. 

What was the hardest part about this project?
Implementing the Filter Kernel due to the handling and implementing the matrices which was really tough.

Is there anything you would change about this project?
We would add more guidlines which will help the programmer, for example, which function we need, what does the arguments do, more of what skeleton code is provided.
